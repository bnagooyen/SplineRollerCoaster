Roller Coaster Simulation

This is a simulator of rollercoaster using catmull splines in order  to construct the tracks.

Different tracks can be used by editing the tracks.txt file with different splines. 

I constructed a railing on the side and used a wood texturing for the tracks in the middle.

The movement function moves the  rollercoaster across the track with the coaster moving faster at a downhill.

The representation of the sky is a skybox with texturing put across each face of the box in order to create a textured sky.

All photos are contained withing the animationShots folder.

In order to compile in visual studio Open with the assign2 solution compileand then run.
