Roller Coaster Simulation

This is a simulator of rollercoaster using catmull splines in order  to construct the tracks.

Different tracks can be used by editing the tracks.txt file with different splines. 

I constructed a railing on the side and used a wood texturing for the tracks in the middle.

The movement function moves the rollercoaster across the track with the coaster moving faster at a downhill.

The representation of the sky is a skybox with texturing put across each face of the box in order to create a textured sky.  There are the photos that are labeled "sk1", "sk2", etc.  

All photos are contained withing the animationShots folder.

In order to compile in Visual Studio Open with the assign2 solution compile and then run.
